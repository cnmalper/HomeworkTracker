# Homework Tracker
Built a Simple Homework Tracker on my 100DaysOfSwiftChallenge. 

## Used Tech:
- CoreData
- Segue
- TableView
- Gesture Recognizers
- Lifecycle
- Optionals
- Picker (UIImagePicker)

## Plus
- I used 2 Segues on the project. If the user wants to save a new homework, he/she will see the first screen (Segue). If the user wants to see his/her homeworks details, he/she will see the second screen (Segue).
